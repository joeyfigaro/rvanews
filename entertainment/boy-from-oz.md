From Richmond Triangle Players:
```
Born in a small town in the Australian outback, Peter Allen (Chris Hester) made his entertainment debut at the age of 5, was later was discovered by the legendary Judy Garland (Grey Garrett), and married her daughter Liza Minnelli (Anna Grey Hogan).

As his career skyrocketed, Allen wrote dozens of hit songs (one of which won an Oscar), and performed to adoring, sell-out crowds at Radio City Music Hall. But he also struggled with his sexuality, lost a lover to AIDS (which would later claim him as well), and gambled his career on what would be a notable Broadway flop.

Allen’s extraordinary life eventually became a major musical, first in Australia and later on Broadway and around the world. RTP’s production will mark its mid-Atlantic debut!

Also starring Barry Pruitt and Jeanie Rule, with Joshua James Crawford, Andrew Etheredge, Alex Farnsworth, Tarnee Kendall Hudson, Brandon McKinney, Luke Newsome, Dante Piro, Dylan Stukenberg, and Katherine S. Wright.
